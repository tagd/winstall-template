;;;Device Specific setup instruction
; This is an example
; I usually write a setup file for each device(laptop, printer etc), 
; Currently this file is psudocode based on emacs use-package, see the README.md for more details
; if the device includes hard to find drivers I may include a link to where I've got them stored
; You may just have this folder in with you main install, I keep it seperate as I change device frequently
